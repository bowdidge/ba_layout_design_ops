      <h2>The Important Stuff</h2>
      <p>
	Welcome to the 2023 S.F. Bay Area Layout Design &amp; Operations Meet!
	This will be our xxth annual meet!
      </p>
      <p>
	The Bay Area Layout Design and Operations meet is a model
	railroading event for modelers interested in model railroad design,
	model railroad operations, railroad and local history, or
	any related topic.
      </p>
      <p>
	The event is a mix of clinics and talks, in-person events,
	and tours of model railroads in the San Francisco Bay Area.
	We also invite attendees to participate in operating sessions 
	on local model railroads, and especially invite folks who haven't
	done operations before to join in.
	If you've like feedback or advice on model railroad design,
	you can sign up for a
	<a href="#consultations">layout design consulting session</a>
	where you can brainstorm or seek advice from other modelers
	about your future layout design.
      </p>
      <p>
	This meet is open to all, regardless of club affiliation or
	membership. NMRA, PCR, LDSIG, or club membership is not
	required!
      </p>
      <p>
	The 2023 meet, like last year, will be a hybrid event.
	You can attend <a href="#clinic_schedule">Saturday clinics</a>
	in-person at the Golden State
	Railroad Museum in Richmond, CA, or you can partipate in the
	clinics via Zoom.
      </p>
      <p>
	Friday's tour and dinner, Saturday night layout tours, and
	Sunday operating sessions are in person.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Sunday, Februrary 5: Operating Sessions</strong></h3>
	<p>
	  As in past years, attendees are invited to participate in a
	  model railroad operating session on one of the layouts in the

	  If you're interested in joining in, mark your interest
