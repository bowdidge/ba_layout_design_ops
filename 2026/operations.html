      <p>
      <p>
	Every year, we invite attendees to the Layout Design and
	Operations meet to participate in an operating session at a
	nearby layout during the meet.  This year's operating sessions
	will be on Saturday.  Indicate your interest in an
	operating session when you buy your ticket.
	We'll send out e-mails closer to the meet to ask about
	layout preferences.
      </p>
      <div class="update">	
	<p>
	  Operating session invites have been sent out to attendees who
	  registered before January 12.  There is still some space
	  on a couple layouts - if you are interested in operating
	  on Saturday but have not yet gotten an invite, send an e-mail
	  to <a href="mailto:contact@bayldops.com">contact@bayldops.com</a>.

      <p>
	Model railroad operations is, essentially, running a model
	railroad like the real thing.  You'll join several other model
	railroaders running trains according to prototype rules,
	switch boxcars at industries, and solve all the challenges and
	complications you face along the way.  Operations varies by
	model railroad - some operating sessions on layouts are
	informal about how trains are run; others try to strictly reproduce
	what would have happened on the real railroad.
	Operating sessions are a fun way to challenge your skills,
	learn about prototype operating practices, and solve problems
	with a group of other model railroaders.
      </p>
      <p>
	We especially encourage model railroaders who've never done
	operations to participate in the operating sessions -
	we intend these operating sessions as a way to learn about
	model railroad operations, a chance to meet the local folks
	who are also into operation, and a chance for you to figure out
	how to do operations on your own layout.
