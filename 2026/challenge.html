      <h1>Layout Design Challenge</h1>
      <p>
	Want to show off your layout design skills, or
	test how well you can design for an unfamiliar space?  Every year, the
	PCR Layout Design &amp; Operations meet suggests a
	particular design problem - how to design a layout for a given
	space, a specific location, or a particularly challenging
	situation.  We invite meet attendees to design a model railroad
	to meet the challenges, then give a short (5 minute) presentation
	at the meet.
      </p>
      <h2>2026 Challenge</h2>
      <p>
	The Santa Clara depot is quite close to Southern Pacific's former
	Lenzen engine facility, home to SP's steam and diesel power over the
	years.  It's a famous location captured in so many photographs.
      </p>
      <p>
	Your challenge is to design an operating layout based on the engine
	terminal itself.  Design a layout that can fit in a 10 foot by 12
	foot bedroom of a typical house.  The layout should model the
	Lenzen Ave. engine facility and any staging you need to model
	locomotive operations at the site.
      </p>
      <p>
	Share your design with attendees, and tell them about your design
	choices and proposed operating scheme in your presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
	Stay tuned for full
	details about this year's layout design challenge rules.
