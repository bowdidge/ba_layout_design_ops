    </p>
    <p>
      Every year, the Bay Area LDSIG meet has a layout design challenge
      where we ask modelers to design to a particular theme, solve a
      particular design problem, or work around some challenging
      constraints.
    </p>
    <h1>This Year's Layout Design Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      This year, we're going international!
      </p>
    <p>
      In Britain, many modelers build “exhibition layouts”: portable
      layouts that can be set up at home or in a clubhouse, but that
      can be brought to meets and shows.  Exhibition layouts often
      have a finely-detailed scene or layout design element on a shelf
      (2 feet x8 feet), joined to a separate staging and fiddle yard that's
      hidden from view. Trains come from staging onto the layout,
      perform switching, and return.  Exhibition layouts usually model
      prototype scenes (often the terminus of a country branch line).
      Realistic operations fit very nicely on these sorts of layouts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your challenge: design an exhibition layout for a North American
      prototype.  Overall dimensions of the layout should not exceed
      24 inches by 16 feet, broken into multiple sections that can fit the
      vehicle of your choice.  The fiddle yard should contain
      sufficient tracks for operation.
    </p>
    <h1>Sharing Your Design at the Meet</h1>
    <p>
      We will share the challenge and all your designs during the clinic
      session of the meet on Saturday, February 4.  Participants can
      either attend the clinic in person, or share their ideas via Zoom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll ask participants to spend 10 minutes talking about their choice:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  why you chose your prototype, and the scene you intend to capture on the model
	</li>
	<li>
	  how you designed your track plan, highlighting any sections interesting for operation or construction
	</li>
	<li>
	  how you'll operate the layout, either for formal operations or when displaying the layout at a show
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants can present either on-site, or remote.  If you're not
      planning to attend the Layout Design meet clinics on Februrary 4, 2023
      at the Golden State Model Railroad Museum,
      then the organizers will help you record a video with your
      remarks beforehand that we can show at the meet.  We'll also ask
      you to be avaiable via Zoom to answer audience questions.
    </p>
    <h1>Need some inspiration?</h1>
    <p>
      Need some ideas for a layout that'll fit on an exhibition-style layout?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Model a quiet terminal: Los Gatos in the 1950's, Cazadero or
	another North Pacific Coast layout in the 1900's, Hawaiian
	sugar cane railroad scene.
      </li>
      <li>
	Model an interesting industrial scene: auto plant, UPS yard,
	city produce district, car ferry.
      </li>
      <li>
	Choose a small prototype: model an interurban terminal
	(Sausalito ferry terminal, Chico on the Sacramento Northern),
	narrow gauge, or modern trolleys.
      </li>
      <li>
	Model a through scene: midwestern small town.
      </li>
    </ul>
