      <h1>Hotels for 2025 PCR Layout Design and Operations meet</h1>
      <p>
	The Layout Design and Operations weekend doesn't have an
	official hotel for the 2025 meet in Sacramento.  Below are
	some of the nearby hotels that you might consider.  As always,
	check review sites (<A href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">tripadvisor.com</a> is our
	favorite) for a better idea about each.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Holiday Inn, Sacramento Downtown - Arena</b>.  Modern
	business hotel, two block walk from the Museum and Old
	Sacramento, bar and restaurant. Looks like $190 a night or so,
	plus $20 a night for parking. Some of us stayed here several years ago,
	and it was good. There's also an Embassy Suites a couple
	blocks south that's likely similar.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Best Western Sandman Hotel</b>
	Budget motel one exit north
	of Old Town at Richards Blvd. and I-5. $110 and free
	parking. There's several other comparable motels at the same
	freeway exit - check reviews on TripAdvisor.com or your
	favorite hotel review site to see how they compare.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Delta King, on the waterfront in Old Sacramento.</b>  Sleep
	on a former river steamboat. Around $200 plus $34 for valet
	parking with in-and-out or park in the Old Sacramento
	lot. None of us have stayed there, but it could be fun if
	you're interested in 20th century transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Home2 Suites by Hilton West Sacramento.</b>  Suites with
	kitchenette.  $143/night with free breakfast plus $10/night
	parking.  About one mile from Old Sacramento on the opposite
	side of the river.
