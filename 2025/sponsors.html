	    Model Railroad Control Systems: Electronics for
	    Operations!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our Mission is to be a hub for open-source
	    hardware for model railroad electronics.  Open source
	    software, such as JMRI, has made a huge contribution to the
	    Model Railroading Hobby. As costs of design and short-run
	    production of electronics (and now models using 3D printing)
	    have dropped dramatically, we saw an opportunity to promote
	    the creation and distribution of Model Railroad electronic
	    hardware by creating a commerce site so that modelers (both
	    those who design and build electronics and those who use them)
	    can have a permanent source of useful off-the shelf
	    community-designed products.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    While it is always nice to get
	    in on a "group buy" you have to know you have the need, be in
	    the loop, and have the cash when the deal comes up.  With
	    <A href="http://modelrailroadcontrolsystems.com">MRCS</a>,
	    you can go to the store any
	    time and order what you need.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our secondary objective is to
	    provide a marketplace for handy parts needed to complete a
	    signaling or communications system. Lastly we provide a
	    variety of product design, layout electrical, signaling and
	    communications design and implementation services.
