	    Model Railroad Control Systems: Electronics for
	    Operations!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our Mission is to be a hub for open-source
	    hardware for model railroad electronics.  Open source
	    software, such as JMRI, has made a huge contribution to the
	    Model Railroading Hobby. As costs of design and short-run
	    production of electronics (and now models using 3D printing)
	    have dropped dramatically, we saw an opportunity to promote
	    the creation and distribution of Model Railroad electronic
	    hardware by creating a commerce site so that modelers (both
	    those who design and build electronics and those who use them)
	    can have a permanent source of useful off-the shelf
	    community-designed products.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    While it is always nice to get
	    in on a "group buy" you have to know you have the need, be in
	    the loop, and have the cash when the deal comes up.  With
	    <A href="http://modelrailroadcontrolsystems.com">MRCS</a>,
	    you can go to the store any
	    time and order what you need.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our secondary objective is to
	    provide a marketplace for handy parts needed to complete a
	    signaling or communications system. Lastly we provide a
	    variety of product design, layout electrical, signaling and
	    communications design and implementation services.

	    <p>
	      The Pacific Locomotive Association, Inc., a 501(c)(3)
	      nonprofit organization, operates Niles Canyon Railway as
	      a living history museum interpreting the importance of
	      our heritage railroads in the development of California
	      and the nation. The purpose of the organization is to
	      preserve the physical aspects and atmosphere of Pacific
	      Coast railroading during the period from 1910 to
	      1960. Our mission is to develop and operate a working
	      railroad museum for the benefit of the general public.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The museum is designed to increase public education,
	      enjoyment, and appreciation of the significance of
	      Americaâ€™s western railroads by:
	      <dl>
		<li>Operating historic railroad equipment using
		standard railroad practices for train crews,
		signaling, block operations, and equipment
		  maintenance.</li>
		<li>
		  Preserving the atmosphere of railroads in small-town
		  America before the 1960s by connecting the historic
		  communities of Sunol, the Niles District of Fremont,
		  and eventually Pleasanton.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Providing educational programs for schools, civic
		  organizations, and community events.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Instructing the public in railroad history, tradition, and the evolution of rail transportation technology.
		</li>
	      </dl>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The Pacific Locomotive Association also has railroad
	      artifacts on display and interpretive educational
	      exhibits at the Sunol Depot.
