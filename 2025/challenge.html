	  We're skipping the layout design challenge this year
	  due to lack of participants.
	  We'll look forward to seeing your great layout design
	  skills at next year's
	  layout design challenge!

	Want to show off your layout design skills, or
	test how well you can design for an unfamiliar space?  Every year, the
	PCR Layout Design &amp; Operations meet suggests a
	particular design problem - how to design a layout for a given
	space, a specific location, or a particularly challenging
	situation.  We invite meet attendees to design a model railroad
	to meet the challenges, then give a short (5 minute) presentation
	at the meet.
      </p>
      <p>
	For this year's design challenge, participants will design a
	part of a modular layout based on Sacramento's R Street
	industrial track.  This was the original 1856 route of the
	Sacramento Valley Railroad and the first railroad in
	California.  By the 1920's, the area had industrial trackage
	for the Southern Pacific and Western Pacific railroads,
	serving a bunch of industries in the area - a perfect setting for
	model railroad switching!

      <p>
	Challenge participants should contact <a href="mailto:brucedmorden@gmail.com">Bruce Morden</a>
	ASAP to note interest.  Submissions and presentation must be
	submitted to Bruce by January 20, 2025.
